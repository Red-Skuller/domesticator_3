I want this version of domesticator to be a little more structure-aware than previous versions

This means both in terms of RNA structure as well as protein structure

Without going full naturalizer, I will use the ideas set out by PreSynCodon. 

I still need to learn viennaRNA/other to be able to effectively tackle the RNA structure

I also want to change up how I do the optimization. dnachisel is fast, so I could do several
rounds of optimization and pick the best one as suggested by several ppl in baker lab.
